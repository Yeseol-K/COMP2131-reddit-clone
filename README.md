## Concepts

In this project there are multiple types of resources.

There are _articles_, which are basically just links to external resources. They have a URL, and a title, and maybe also some commentary text.

There are _comments_, on articles, which are basically just some text.

There are _subjeddits_, aka "subs", which organize several articles together under a theme.

There are _users_, because every sub, every article, and every comment, needs to know which user it belongs to.
